# Persisted queries showcase

## Introduction

This project has for purpose to reproduce a problem that affected us while implementing persisted queries with the current tooling that is provided by apollo.

We need two things to implement persisted queries:

- Generate a list of all queries of the app, with a hash of these queries
- Apollo client should send the hash instead of the query at run time

## Generate a list of all queries of the app, with a hash of these queries

We used [apollo-tooling](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling). We can extract the queries from this repository by running

```
npm run queries:extract
```

This will run the script `apollo client:extract extracted-queries.json` and generate the file [extracted-queries.json](extracted-queries.json)

## Apollo client should send the hash instead of the query at run time

This is done by adding `apollo-link-persisted-queries` to apollo client. You can see the result by visiting the [deployed app](https://abumalick.github.io/persisted-queries-showcase/). Look in the Network tab of devtools, in the bottom of the Headers tab you will find the hash in the `Request Payload` object.

## The problem

The hash generated by `apollo-link-persisted-queries` is different from the one generated by `apollo-tooling`.

At time of writing, I get `14ac5ae57bd5679435b8e80f00e57c054e2ecaf7034b97e45adf6830c731afbb` in the browser, and `638a6e757933d0e452d6bcf2e9745b4fb4082744b54c19ca094d09862c56a593` in my extracted queries.

## Notes

We tried to use the nearly deprecated [persistgraphql](https://github.com/apollographql/persistgraphql) to pack the queries, but we found out that it does not add `__typename` to the queries, and apollo-client needs that data in the response.

# Create react app documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
